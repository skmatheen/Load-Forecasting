# Load Forecasting in Smart Grids

## Overview
This project implements **load forecasting** using **quadratic regression** to predict electricity demand based on temperature variations. The approach is applied in the context of **smart grids**, where accurate forecasting helps in optimizing energy distribution and grid efficiency.

## Methodology
- **Quadratic Regression Model**: Used to capture both **linear and non-linear** relationships between temperature and electricity load.
- **Training Period**: The model is trained on **2019-2023 data** to compute regression coefficients.
- **Prediction Period**: The model is applied to **2014-2018 data** for validation.
- **Dynamic Slicing**: The forecasting task is distributed across three servers:
  - **Server 1 (Jan-Apr)**
  - **Server 2 (May-Aug)**
  - **Server 3 (Sep-Dec)**
- **Partial Verification**: A randomly selected month from each server's forecast is re-computed and validated.

## Model Equation
The quadratic regression model follows the equation:

\[
\text{Load} = β_0 + β_1 \times \text{Temperature} + β_2 \times \text{Temperature}^2
\]

where:
- **β0**: Intercept
- **β1**: Linear coefficient
- **β2**: Quadratic coefficient

The coefficients are computed using **Ordinary Least Squares Estimation (OLSE)**.


## How to Use

### 1️ Clone the Repository
To download the project, clone it from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Load_Forecasting.git
cd Load_Forecasting

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3️⃣ Run the Model
Step 1: Train the Model
Run the script to train the quadratic regression model and compute coefficients:

python experiment.py

Step 2: Forecast Load
The script will automatically apply the trained model to predict load for 2014-2018.

Step 3: Verify Predictions
The script will perform partial verification by re-computing predictions for a randomly selected month.

### 4️⃣ Output
After running the script:
Predicted load values will be displayed.
Execution times for each server and verification will be printed.
